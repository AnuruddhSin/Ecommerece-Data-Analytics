1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnuruddhSin/Ecommerece-Data-Analytics.git
   cd Ecommerece-Data-Analytics/Ecommerece Data Analytics
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary Python packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Analysis**:
   Run the `data_analussc.py` script to perform data analysis.
   ```bash
   python data_analussc.py
   ```

4. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   Open the `Dashboard Ecommerce.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop to explore the visualizations and insights.

### Files Description

- **Dashboard Ecommerce.pbix**: This file contains the Power BI dashboard that provides various visualizations and insights derived from the e-commerce data. You can open this file using Power BI Desktop to explore and interact with the visualizations. The dashboard includes several key metrics and visual representations such as sales trends, top-selling products, customer demographics, and geographic sales distribution. This helps businesses understand their performance and identify areas for improvement.

- **data_analussc.py**: This Python script is used for data analysis. It reads the e-commerce transaction data, performs various analytical operations, and outputs the results. The script is designed to handle data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation tasks. It includes functions to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value. Additionally, it can generate visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a deeper understanding of the data.

- **ecommerce_data.csv**: This CSV file contains the raw e-commerce transaction data used for analysis. It includes various fields such as transaction ID, product details, customer information, transaction amount, and date. This dataset serves as the primary input for the analysis and dashboard creation. It provides a comprehensive record of transactions, allowing for detailed analysis of sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

- **Final Back.jpg**: An image file used as a background or asset in the project. This file may be utilized in the Power BI dashboard or other visualizations to enhance the aesthetic appeal and provide context to the data being presented.

- **SQLQuery1.sql**: This SQL file contains queries used to extract or manipulate data from a database. It is useful if you are working with a SQL database and need to fetch specific data for analysis. The queries included in this file can be customized to match the structure of your database and the specific requirements of your analysis. They provide a starting point for extracting relevant data and can be adapted to handle more complex queries as needed.

- **us_state_long_lat_codes.csv**: This CSV file contains longitude and latitude codes for US states, which can be used for geospatial analysis and mapping. This file is particularly useful for creating maps and visualizations that show sales distribution across different geographic regions. By combining this data with the e-commerce transaction data, you can create insightful visualizations that highlight regional sales patterns and identify potential market opportunities.

- **SS Ecommerece Dash/**: This directory contains screenshots of various Power BI dashboards. These images showcase the different types of dashboards available in this project:
  - **Main_dash.png**: Main dashboard overview.
  - **coperate_dash.png**: Corporate performance dashboard.
  - **home_office.png**: Home office sales dashboard.
  - **sales_by_state_focus.png**: Sales distribution by state dashboard.

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   The first step in the project is to collect e-commerce transaction data. This can be obtained from various sources such as an online store's database, third-party e-commerce platforms, or publicly available datasets. The collected data should be stored in a structured format, such as a CSV file, to facilitate analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Before analyzing the data, it is essential to preprocess it to ensure it is clean and consistent. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and normalizing the data. The `data_analussc.py` script includes functions for these preprocessing tasks, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data and identifying patterns and trends. It involves generating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and exploring relationships between different variables. The `data_analussc.py` script includes various functions for performing EDA, such as calculating descriptive statistics, plotting histograms, and generating correlation matrices.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   After completing the EDA, the next step is to perform more detailed analysis to derive actionable insights. This can include segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior, identifying top-selling products, and analyzing sales trends over time. The `data_analussc.py` script includes functions for these analyses, providing a comprehensive overview of the e-commerce data.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   Visualizations play a crucial role in communicating the results of the analysis. The Power BI dashboard included in this project provides interactive visualizations that make it easy to explore the data and gain insights. Key metrics and trends are displayed in a visually appealing manner, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand the performance of the e-commerce business.

   The provided screenshots of the Power BI dashboards can be found in the `SS Ecommerece Dash` directory:
